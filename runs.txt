Best so far: "eagle smaller" -> Densification interval: 500 densify always

Next steps:
- GSplat with MCMC Densification // no, bad results so far
- Self organizing gaussians for storage
- Rely on single config file, not per-model
- NTC warmup within the training script
- First load iteration default to max iter

For exporting:
- Select edited init splats
- Load each frame ntc, deform, then export the frame


With this we solve:
- Editing: Just edit once and apply for all frames
- Storage: State of the art compression - Even more so with video
- Bounce artifacts: Non existent since no sections are used
- Speed: 

Idea: Initialize on previous NTC? Momentum should be kept in theory no?
